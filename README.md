Objective

Develop a user-friendly command-line calculator application capable of performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Implement error handling to manage edge cases such as division by zero and invalid input formats, ensuring robust functionality and user experience.
Incorporate support for advanced operations like exponentiation and modulus to enhance the calculator's utility for both simple and complex calculations.
Design the calculator to maintain a clear and intuitive user interface, allowing users to input calculations efficiently and receive accurate results promptly.
Utilize Python's standard libraries and best practices for code readability and maintainability, facilitating future enhancements and modifications to the calculator's functionality.

Key Activities

User Input Handling:

Receive user input for mathematical expressions or individual operations.
Arithmetic Operations:

Implement functions to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Error Handling:

Include error handling to manage potential issues such as division by zero or invalid input formats (e.g., non-numeric characters).
Displaying Results:

Output the calculated results to the user in a clear and understandable format.
Loop for Continuous Operation:

Provide a mechanism (e.g., a loop) that allows the calculator to continue operating until the user decides to exit or terminate the program.
